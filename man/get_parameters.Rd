\arguments{
\item{iso3}{The ISO3 code of the country used to draw age-distributions and
contact rates from.}

\item{R0}{The basic reproduction number.}

\item{generation_time}{The mean generation time in days.}

\item{incubation_period}{The mean incubation period in days.}

\item{infectiousness_presymp}{Relative infectiousness of presymptomatic cases
to symptomatic cases.}

\item{frac_symp}{The proportion of cases that eventually develop symptoms.}

\item{ifr}{Infection fatality rate provided either as a single value or as a
vector of the same length as the number of age categories. Use the function
\code{age_to_ifr} to calculate a COVID-like IFR from a vector of ages.}

\item{hosp_mortality}{The probability of death given a case is admitted to
hospital, either as a single value or as a vector of the same length as the
number of age categories. The inverse of the number of cases admitted to
hospital per death.}

\item{hosp_protection_death}{Given a case requires hospitalisation, the
proportion of deaths admission to hospital averts.}

\item{hosp_duration}{The mean duration of stay in the hospital in days,
either as a single value or as a vector of the same length as the number of
age categories.}

\item{hosp_capacity}{Total hospital bed capacity given as a proportion of the
population.}

\item{comm_mortality}{The probability of death of cases that remain in the
community, either as a single value or as a vector of the same length as the
number of age categories.}

\item{vax_rate}{The daily rate of vaccination as a proportion of the population.}

\item{vax_infectiousness}{The reduction (as a proportion) in infectioussness
of an individual due to vaccination.}

\item{vax_infection}{The protection (as a proportion) against infection
provided by vaccination.}

\item{vax_hosp}{The protection (as a proportion) against hospitalisation
provided by vaccination, given infection.}

\item{vax_death}{The protection (as a proportion) against death provided by
vaccination, given hospitalisation.}

\item{isolation_adherence}{The proportion of symptomatic individuals that
adhere to isolation measures.}

\item{isolation_effectiveness}{The reduction in daily transmission potential
of a given individual due to adherence to isolation measures.}

\item{isolation_delay}{The mean delay from symptom onset to isolation in
days.}

\item{social_distancing}{A named vector of length 4 containing the proportion
reduction in contacts due to social distancing of 'home', 'school', 'work'
and 'other'.}

\item{vax_prioritised}{A logical indicating whether older age groups are
vaccinated first.}

\item{hosp_prioritised}{A logical indicating whether older age groups are
hospitalised first when hospital capacity is exceeded.}
