\arguments{
\item{simexl}{The solved system of equations as returned by \code{run_model}.}

\item{what}{What to plot: one of "prevalence" (number in each category per
day), "deltas" (change in prevalence from one day to the next) and
"incidence" (new additions to that compartment per day).}

\item{format}{One of "timeline" (shows a timeline stratified by compartment
and vaccination status) or "endpoint" (shows the final value stratified by
age category).}

\item{log}{Logical indicating whether a log scale should be used.}

\item{use_absolute_numbers}{Logical indicating whether absolute absolute
numbers (in terms of individuals) should be shown or relative to population
size.}

\item{show_compartment}{The compartment to show when using \code{format =
"endpoint"}.}

\item{freescales}{Logical indicating whether the different comparments should
use different y-axes.}

\item{base_size}{Base size passed to theme_*}
